# Dognition_MySQL

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing and cleaning data from Dognition, a platform that provides insights into dog cognition based on a series of structured games. The goal is to examine the provided database, clean the data, create a relational schema, identify data issues, and generate meaningful insights.

This project was completed as part of a team assignment for the MQM 2023â€“2024 Data Infrastructure course.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Data Cleaning and Relational Schema
Dropped duplicate records from all tables.
Established primary keys where possible.
Created a relational schema using ERDPlus.
Defined foreign key relationships between tables.
### Task 2: Data Issues and Fixes
Investigated and summarized inconsistencies and data quality issues.
Suggested potential fixes and assumptions for missing or erroneous data.
### Task 3: User Sign-Up Analysis
Generated user sign-up statistics (by year and month).
Computed percentage breakdown of membership types.
Investigated the correlation between sign-up time, subscription type, and test completion.

## Technologies Used

Python (for data analysis)  
SQL (for data manipulation and extraction)  
ERDPlus (for relational schema creation)  
Pandas (for data manipulation)

## Results and Analysis

Found and resolved several data consistency issues in the exam_answers and site_activities tables.  
Established foreign key relationships between users, dogs, and complete_tests.  
Identified user behavior patterns and correlations between subscription types and retention rates.  
Proposed recommendations to improve user retention based on test completion data.
